# fps-desktop 

A FPS-like desktop widget for linux and windows

## Development
1. Download or clone this project
2. Open this project with godot

## Notes
- I used ScreenGetImage() to adjust the lighting
on the model. Currently godot has a memory
leak bug on this function, but it should be fixed
on the next (beta) release.
